    "long_description": "Next to the station in the Hack Club neighbourhood, is a cafe run by an old man. Well-beloved by the community, he knows everything about every place in the neighbourhood. He was once a professor at a local high school, seeing through the progression of hackers through the ages. Nowadays, he has retired, with fond memories of his experiences. When a newcomer arrives in the community, he invites them in to his cafe for a nice chat and a cup of tea (or other warm beverage of their choice), to help them settle in. When they leave, he gives them a bouquet of home-grown flowers and a warm smile. He keeps an Orpheus plush with a flower crown on the counter of the cafe."
